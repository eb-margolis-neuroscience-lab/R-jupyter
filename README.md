R_for_mixedmeasures_anal_and_graphs

This code is designed to test mixed data with both within- and between subjects factors.
Packages required:
* tidyverse
* dplyr
* tidyr
* statix
* ggplot2
* plotly
* orca (for saving plotly graphics to svg)

The code is provided in two formats: R script and Jupyter notebook. In addition to the full statistical analysis, the code generates a violin plot to represent data distributions and a pre- post- dot plot to inspect within-individual differences between measurements.

_Warning: our experience running the R based Jupyter notebook via Anaconda has been inconsistent between computers._
