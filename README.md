# R_for_mixedmeasures_anal_and_graphs
Mixed ANOVA Worksheet, 2 Observations, 2 Groups

This code is designed to test mixed data with both within- and between subjects factors.

*Updated 12/28/2021:* Added an R Notebook version that outputs an HTML record of the output.  This version requires tidyverse, ggpubr, statix. 

Packages required:
* tidyverse
* dplyr
* tidyr
* statix
* ggplot2
* plotly
* orca (for saving plotly graphics to svg)

The code is provided in two formats: R script and Jupyter notebook. In addition to the full statistical analysis, the code generates a violin plot to represent data distributions and a pre- post- dot plot to inspect within-individual differences between measurements. These plots can be saved as vector art for figure construction.
